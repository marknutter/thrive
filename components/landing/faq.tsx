    question: "What exactly do I get with Sprintbook?",
    answer:
      "You get a production-ready Next.js application with authentication (email/password, OAuth, 2FA), SQLite database, Stripe subscription billing, transactional email via Resend, a full component library, dark mode, and deployment configuration — all wired up and ready to customize.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Sprintbook a SaaS or a template?",
    answer:
      "Sprintbook is a template you own entirely. Clone the repository, customize it, and deploy it anywhere. There are no ongoing fees for the code itself — you only pay for the Pro plan if you want premium features and priority support.",
  },
  {
    question: "What databases are supported?",
    answer:
      "Sprintbook ships with SQLite via better-sqlite3 for zero-config local development. The data layer is designed to be swappable — you can migrate to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any other database when you're ready to scale.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Sprintbook for commercial projects?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Sprintbook is licensed for both personal and commercial use. Build your startup, client project, or side hustle — there are no restrictions on what you build with it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does authentication work?",
    answer:
      "Sprintbook uses Better Auth, a modern authentication library. It supports email/password login, Google and GitHub OAuth, two-factor authentication (TOTP), email verification, and password reset flows — all pre-configured and ready to go.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to set up Stripe separately?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you'll need your own Stripe account (free to create). Sprintbook provides the complete integration — checkout sessions, webhooks, billing portal, and subscription management. Just add your Stripe API keys and price IDs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I deploy Sprintbook?",
    answer:
      "Sprintbook includes a Dockerfile, docker-compose configuration, and Caddy server config. Push to GitHub, build the Docker image, and deploy to any VPS, cloud provider, or container platform. You can also deploy to Vercel or similar platforms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes! The free plan gives you access to core features including authentication, database, and basic deployment configuration. Upgrade to Pro for premium components, priority support, and early access to new features.",
